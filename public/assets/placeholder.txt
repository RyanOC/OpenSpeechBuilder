This directory contains placeholder assets for the soundboard.

For a real implementation, you would add:
- PNG/JPG images for each pad (yes.png, no.png, etc.)
- MP3/WAV audio files for each pad (yes.mp3, no.mp3, etc.)

The current config references these files:
- yes.png, yes.mp3
- no.png, no.mp3  
- hello.png, hello.mp3
- goodbye.png, goodbye.mp3
- please.png, please.mp3
- thankyou.png, thankyou.mp3
- help.png, help.mp3
- stop.png, stop.mp3

You can replace these with your own assets or update the config to point to different files.
